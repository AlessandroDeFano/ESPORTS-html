							<h3>
								Will Jay “Sinatraa” Won return to play on
								Valorant?
							</h3>
						</a>
						<div class="news-news">

							<div class="news-news-content">
								<p>
									The suspension that led Jay “Sinatraa” Won,
									former Overwatch League MVP who later
									switched to Valorant, to no longer be able
									to compete in the Riot Games game is over.
									And now one wonders if Sinatraa, who is part
									of Sentinels and who had begun to show
									interesting skills in Valorant, will resume
									his business.
								</p>
								<p>
									In March, Won was suspended after his
									ex-girlfriend accused him of sexual haras
									<span id="dots2">...</span
									><span id="more2"
										>sment. At that point, Riot Games had
										initiated an investigation to clarify
										the matter and for the duration of the
										investigation had decided to suspend Won
										from any professional Valorant
										tournament. In May Riot Games announced
										that its internal investigation was over
										and that, in fact, it had decided to
										suspend Won for six months with effect
										from 10 March. Therefore, on 10
										September last, Won's six-month
										suspension expired.
										<strong>AND NOW?</strong> - The expiry
										of the suspension, however, has not yet
										coincided with a return of Won on the
										professional scene. In May, on the
										sidelines of the announcement of his
										suspension, Won stated that he did not
										know if he would ever resume business,
										but that he would continue to stream his
										games on Valorant. In a note published
										on Twitter he also stressed that "I
										still have four months of exclusion from
										tournaments to try to develop a better
										set of interpersonal skills and regain
										the trust of this community". For now,
										Sinatraa has evaded any comment on the
										matter. It seems that, for now, it will
										remain on the sidelines of the Valorant
										scene.

									In 2021, the export market trend was the
									protagonist of a real roller coaster ride.
									If on the one hand the lockdown on a global
									scale has forced hundreds of millions of
									people within the walls of their homes,
									enormously increasing the numbers of the
									viewership, on the other hand, those who had
									invested in certain business models found
									themselves having to take a hard blow all

										>ced to pull the plug, for example,
										League of Legends has broken new records
										with its Worlds. But if a company like
										Riot Games has had the opportunity to
										celebrate, others like
										Activision-Blizzard have experienced an
										unprecedented crisis in their offering
										export. How violent has the impact of
										the pandemic on gaming actually been
										competitive? Finally we have some
										metrics available to be able to draw the
										first ones estimates. INDICATORS -
										Several conflicting signs have emerged
										over the last few months. There has been
										much discussion about the crisis that
										has characterized city-based esports
										franchise leagues,
										<href
											="https:
                                        //esports.gazzetta.it/news/17-08-2021/overwatch-league-a-rischio-potrebbe-saltare-un-anno-esports-63653"

										and its
										<href
											="https:
                                            //esports.gazzetta.it/news/17-08-2021/overwatch-league-a-rischio-potrebbe-saltare-un-anno-esports-63653"
										>
											Call of Duty equivalent</href
										>
										from Activision-Blizzard. There has been
										talk of an impressive growth in the
										ecosystem of streaming broadcasts, so
										much so that the average hours of
										viewership dedicated to export have
										reached peaks never seen before. There
										was also talk of companies put up for
										sale, such as the owner of the famous
										Las Vegas arena Allied Esports. In
										short, it is extremely complicated to
										assess the general trend of the sector,
										since a sort of recession seems to have
										followed with the increase in
										visibility. But it is possible to try to
										clarify by studying the latest data
										collected by Esportearnings and The
										Esport Observer.
										<strong>The backward economy?</strong>-
										There are three figures that have made
										some insiders turn their eyebrows, such
										as the vice president of France Esports
										Nicolas Besombes. The first is in the
										numbers of the export tournaments held
										every year, which have gone from 5,654
										in 2019 to just 2,428 events in 2021; it
										was not since 2013 that such a low
										figure has been recorded. The second is
										in the sums up for grabs in the main
										events, which jumped back five years:
										considering that in 2016 91 million
										dollars were invested in this way, and
										that growth did not stop until 257.5
										million prize pools placed in 2019, it
										could be strange to see the sum drop to
										only 81 million dollars in 2021. The
										latest figure is in the groove that has
										touched the average earnings of all
										professionals in the sector at all
										levels, which are went from $ 8,300 in
										2019 to $ 5,700 in 2021.
