# _Usage_

In order to use this application the index file should be opened in a browser of choice.
In order to be able to run the backend page:

-   Download a local server (we used apache with xampp)
-   Copy the folder in the htdocs folder created by xampp if using Windows
-   If using a Debian based Linux distribution the folder should be copied in the `/var/www/html/` folder
-   If using an Arch based Linux distribution the folder should be copied in the `/srv/http/` folder

# _Configuration and technical characteristics_

-   The user doesn't need to configure anything in order to run the application unless he needs to access the backend page in wich case the instructions have been givven in the _usage_ section

-   The page uses a reset.css file since all of the elements will be styled later on by us
