                        E-Sports are the competitive and professional level video game competitions. The games that are part of it are usually multiplayer, although it is also possible to compete with single-player games, trying to get the highest score. Live tournaments are
                        organized like any other sporting event, with referees and commentators specialized in the specific game. The competition in E-Sports is fierce and there can only be one true champion. If you’re a master gamer who crushes their
